Secondly, as the running config (`RunConfig` or `ParallelConfig`) has `model_config` attribute, you will need to create a custom running config class as well (decorated with `configclass` decorator), updating `model_config` argument to proper type. Only after this can the running config object be used in `ablator` launcher.\n",
