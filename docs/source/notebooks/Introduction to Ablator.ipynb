    "### Ablation Studies\n",
    "\n",
    "An ablation study is a type of experimental analysis that is used to understand the impact of different components on a ML model. Ablation studies involve removing specific parts of a neural network architecture or changing different aspects of the training process to examine their individual contributions to the model's performance.\n",
    " \n",
    "By selectively removing or modifying components/parameters, researchers observe how the changes affect the system's output, performance, or behavior. \n",

    "\n",
    "This section introduces the core modules within Ablator. We'll cover the Configuration Module, Training Module, Experiment Result Metrics Module, and Analysis Module. These modules collectively contribute to Ablator's seamless experiment management and insightful analysis capabilities. \n",
    "\n",
    "[**Configuration Module -**](https://ablator-tutorials.readthedocs.io/en/v0.0.1-misc/notebooks/Configuration-Basics.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "In Ablator, this configuration system serves as a sort of foundation for crafting experiments. It enables researchers to set up the fine details. In Ablator, settings are neatly grouped into various categories for easy organization. They are \n",
    "\n",
    "- Model configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "- Training configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "- Optimizer and Scheduler configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "- Running configurations\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexibility is a big plus with this configuration system. It lets researchers tailor their experiments to their specific aims and hypotheses.\n",

    "After setting up the experiment configurations using the configuration module.The trainer module takes these configurations and handles the execution of the experiment, whether it's a single prototype experiment (using ProtoTrainer) or a parallel experiment with hyperparameter optimization (using ParallelTrainer). This module has a training interface, Model Wrapper, it encapsulates common boilerplate code, abstracts the  repetitive tasks.The Configuration Module along with the trainer module acts like a blueprint for shaping the experiment.\n",

    "[**Experiment result metrics module -**](https://ablator-tutorials.readthedocs.io/en/v0.0.1-misc/results.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "This class plays a pivotal role in capturing the performance of models. It receives predictions and outputs after the training of the ML model, and applys specific evaluation functions to calculate metrics.\n",

    "\n",
    "The Analysis module in Ablator provides essential tools for visualizing and interpreting the outcomes of ablation experiments. The Analysis module consists of two main classes: `PlotAnalysis` and `Results`. The Analysis module comes into play after the training and evaluation are complete. It takes the experiment results, which include metrics and hyperparameters, and processes them using the `Results` class. The processed data is then visualized using the `PlotAnalysis` class, creating insightful plots that illustrate how hyperparameters impact model performance.\n",

    "### What happens in the background once ABLATOR is launched? \n",
    "\n",
    "Trials are executed in parallel using the Ray cluster and coordinated through the Optuna library. The combination of these two tools enables efficient and distributed hyperparameter optimization.\n",
    " \n",
    "Here's how the parallel execution process works:\n",
    " \n",
    "Step 1 - <u>Generating Trials and Configurations </u>\n",
    "\n",
    "- The user defines a set of hyperparameters to search over, creating a search space.\n",
    "- The user can specifies both the desired number of trials and the number of trails for parallel execution (Concurrent Trails).  \t\n",
    "- These trial configurations are instances of the `ParallelConfig` class, containing information about the hyperparameters and other experiment settings. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2 - <u>Ray Cluster Setup</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ablator will take care of setting up the ray cluster.\n",
    "- However, if desired, the user can manually establish a cluster and provide its address    through  'ray_head_address'. This directs the experiment to that specific cluster.\t\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "Step 3 - <u>Launching Remote Functions</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Once the remote setup is in place, both the configuration and the training interface (known as the ModelWrapper) are sent to the cluster together.\n",
    "- These two components collaborate to facilitate the execution of training and evaluation tasks seamlessly.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "Step 4 - <u>Parallel Execution</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- The remote functions are scheduled to run on available worker nodes in the Ray cluster.\n",
    "- Ray's task scheduling is asynchronous, allowing new tasks to be submitted even while others are running.\n",
    "- This parallel execution enables multiple trials to be performed concurrently on different nodes, utilizing the available cluster resources efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 5 - <u>Optuna's Role</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Optuna manages the orchestration of the trials' execution and hyperparameter optimization.\n",
    "- It tracks the progress of each trial, records intermediate results. \n",
    "- As the trials run in parallel, Optuna collects and analyzes their performance to guide the exploration of the search space effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 6 - <u>Monitoring and Updating</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- The progress of the trails are monitored.\n",
    "- When a trial completes, the results (e.g., training metrics) are collected and evaluated.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 7 - <u>Synchronization and Data Management</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Completed trials' information, including metrics and states, are synchronized and stored\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 8 - <u>Evaluation and Further Optimization</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Analysis module within Ablator examines the data and creates informative plots.\n",
    "-  Ablator aids in comprehending how different components influence the model's performance, extending its evaluation beyond individual trials\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "By using Ray cluster for running things in parallel and Optuna's hyperparameter optimization, this process makes it much easier to explore hyperparameter search space more efficiently and aids in finding optimal configurations for improved machine learning model performance."
